# Notes on Coding Interview Preparations

## How this book is structured:
* Uses `mdbook`, which is written in Rust to create a book.
* `book/` directory is where the book gets rendered.
* `src/` directory is where the verbiage gets written.
* `SUMMARY.md` defines the skeleton of the book, extremely important.

## Installation
* Download Rust.
* `cargo install mdbook`
* `mdbook serve`
* Go to `localhost:3000`
