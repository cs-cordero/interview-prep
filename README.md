# Technical Interview Preparation

## What is this?

This repository contains my personal notes and coding solutions to various data structures & algorithms questions, mostly from [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com).

## How is everything organized?

### Coding solutions
All data structures & algorithm problem solutions are organized in their source-labeled folders.  Most of them come from the LeetCode website, which can be found in [the LeetCode folder](./leetcode), which is organized by problem number.

### Notebook
I use [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), which is a tool written in Rust to create a notebook from the markdown files found in the [src](./src) directory.

### Installation
If you are interested in seeing the notes in its book format, you would need to use the `mdbook` tool to create and render the book. Here are the steps involved:
1. Download Rust.
1. Run `cargo install mdbook`
1. Run `mdbook serve`
1. Go to `localhost:3000`
