# Abstract Data Types

## Data Structure
A *data structure* (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

An *abstract data type* (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.  The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
* ADTs are like the specification of the DS, not the implementation.

### Examples
| ADT | DS |
|:---:|:---:|
|List|Dynamic Array, Linked List|
|Queue|Linked List-based Queue, Array-based Queue, Stack-based Queue|
|Map|Tree Map, Hash Map/Hash Table|
|Vehicle|Golf Cart, Bicycle, Smart Car|
